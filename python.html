        <h1>Story Synopsis</h1>
        You start your first day at Dunder Mifflin Scranton. You control how 
        <br>
        your day will go as you interact with certain characters and follow
        <br> 
        through certain actions. Your day at Scranton might not be quite so
        <br>
        enjoyable afterall.
        <h1>Concepts Used</h1>
        The concept that was the most impactful in our story was the while loops.
        <br>
        The usage of the while loop allowed us to set up certain conditions that
        <br>
        would influence the ending of our story. While the while loops were the 
        <br>
        most impactful, the code that sets our story apart from other groups' is
        <br>
        the usage of variables. Throughout the story, we set up variables that 
        <br>
        would be changed as you progress through the story. These variables 
        <br>
        would later be used in the while loops in order to determine the ending  
        <br>
        that the audience would receive.
        <h1>Favorite Story</h1>
        I really enjoyed Helen and Leanne in particular because their story was 
        <br>
        straight to the point and gave me some realistic endings, such as dying
        <br>
        by choking on boba or by Brunner. Just by adding Brunner, their story 
        <br> 
        was immediately that much better or worse depending on how you look at 
        <br>
        it. Overall, I really had fun while going through their story.
