        <h1>Scratch Game Reflection Questions</h1>
        <p1>
        <ul>
            <li>1. The most useful structure that I learned was the looping 
            <br>algorithm that allowed the sprite in the game to cycle through 
            <br>costumes that made it look like it was moving.</li>
            <li>2. The biggest struggle while creating the game was cycling the
            <br> sprite movement. In the end, we used a cycling command that 
            <br> allowed us to change the costumes according to the direction.</li>
            <li>3. My favorite part about the game is the movement of our 
            <br> character sprite and monster sprite.</li>
            <li>4. I think that we could've added more levels to our game if we
            <br> were given more time, but we did all the concepts that we originally
            <br> wanted to try.</li>
        </ul>
